This repository contains a Python function `calculate_average` that computes the average of a list of numbers.  It addresses the common `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when attempting to calculate the average of an empty list.  The `bug.py` file demonstrates the function's functionality, including a test case with an empty list. The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected function to avoid the error.
